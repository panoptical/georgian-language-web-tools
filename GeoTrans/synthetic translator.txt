Synthetic Translater:

 - look up the word
  - success: return def(word)
  - fail: 
    - remove some morphology
    - look up result
      - success: return def(result) + def(morph)
      - fail:
        - look up permutations of result









Put morphology in key, value pairs

key = morph
value = meaning

noun cases:

{ 
"ი": "nom",
"ო": "voc",
"ის": "gen",  

 - but this is problematic
 - because there are lots of special cases!
