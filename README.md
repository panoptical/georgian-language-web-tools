georgian-language-web-tools
===========================

A set of tools for dealing with Georgian language on the internet.

The first project is to create a Georgian language transcription tool using html and javascript.  This project currently works but is very primitive.

Somewhere along the line I want to create browser extensions/apps that transcribe web pages automatically from Georgian into English.

Eventually, parsing and translation tools may be added.
